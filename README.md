1) Firstly, I want to apologise because I could not complete the whole case study. I managed to complete the script part but I did not manage to copy the output into output.json due to my lack of knowledge. I only managed to convert every integer 3 into 'BIG', every integer 5 into 'BANG' and both 3 and 5 to 'BIG BANG'. 
2) To run the script, just copy the script below and paste it in online Javascript compiler. I use this webiste https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/
3) Run and you will see the result.
4) This is the script: [ouput.txt](https://github.com/nurfawa/README/files/10993195/ouput.txt)
